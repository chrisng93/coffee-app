# Coffee Around Me - Frontend

## Install dependencies
From within the root directory, run the following command to install dependencies:
```
yarn install
```

## Run the application
1. If you're running the [Coffee Around Me backend](https://github.com/chrisng93/coffee-backend/blob/master/README.md)
(which I would recommend doing, since the frontend is just a map without it), then set the API URL for that backend
by running the following command in your terminal:
```
export API_URL=${API_URL}
```
2. From the root directory, run the following command:
```
yarn run dev
```
